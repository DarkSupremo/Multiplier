* Random Skills / Change Skills on Death
- Added abilities from picked heroes to the abilities pool, so it will increase the number of abilities avaliable without the need to precache more heroes

* General
- Reworked stats gained per level, instead of getting it fully multiplied, you'll get bonus only to your primary stats x3 (stats gain * 2)
- Armor provided by item and agility will be multiplied by 3 (on x20, every 126 agility you'll gain 1 armor, instead of 140)
- PS: Remember that armor given by Agility is bugged on UI due to an bug on Dota API, but internally it will works like i said above (I'll try to workaround it soon)

- When the mode selected is Same Hero, it will allow to pick the same hero, to prevent users from picking an hero and make host unable to select it. (This mode is meant to make all heroes same as the host)
